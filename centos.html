          <p>CentOS (abbreviated from Community Enterprise Operating System) is a Linux distribution that attempts to provide a free, enterprise-class, community-supported computing platform which aims to be functionally compatible with its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).</p>
          <p>In January 2014, CentOS announced the official joining with Red Hat while staying independent from RHEL, under a new CentOS governing board.</p>
          <p>The first CentOS release in May 2004, numbered as CentOS version 2, was forked from RHEL version 2.1AS. Since the release of version 7.0, CentOS officially supports only the x86-64 architecture, while versions older than 7.0-1406 also support IA-32 with Physical Address Extension (PAE), with additional architectures supported in CentOS versions older than 4.7. As of November 2015, AltArch releases of CentOS 7 are available for the IA-32 architecture and for the AArch64 variant of the ARM architecture.</p>
